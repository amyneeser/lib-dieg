## Git for Librarians

> Objectives
- Differentiate between Git and Github
- Know what a _repo_ is
- See how commands like:  _status_, _add_, _commit_, _push_, and _pull_ are used

## *What* is Git & Github

> Version Control: Like *undo* with superpowers

> Git: The language

> Github: A service for the language

> Available in different desktop GUIs



## So, *What*

> Tools like this advance transparency. Transparency advances science and culture.

> This is how many researchers and leaners who code in your domains work and will work in the foreseeable future

> More and more librarians use Git for their own projects

> More and more librarians introduce Git as a workflow/management solution to their researchers.

> You can work offline

> You can time-travel and go to different states of your work infinitely.


## *What's* Next?

> We're going to use this to store our DIEG teach-Ins. Together, we'll troubleshoot and learn in a way that allows us to use Git in a simplified, immediately usable way.

> Library Carpentries lesson


## *What* if?

> My researchers definitely don't use this and never will.


> I have no idea what I'm doing?




## Sample Workflow

```git init``` ->
```git status``` ->
```git clone```->
```git add``` ->
```git commmit``` ->
