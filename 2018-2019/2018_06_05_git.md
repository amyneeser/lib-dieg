## Git for Data Initiatives Expertise Group

> Objectives
- Differentiate between Git and Github
- Know what a _repo_ is
- See how commands like:  _status_, _add_, _commit_, _push_,  _fetch_, _merge_ are used

## *What* is Git & Github

- Version Control: Like *undo*  and *history* with superpowers

- Git: The language

- Github: A service for the language

- Available in different desktop GUIs

- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)


## So, *What*

- Tools like this advance transparency. Transparency advances scholarship.

- This is how many researchers and leaners who code in your domains work and will work in the foreseeable future

- More and more librarians use Git for their own projects

- More and more librarians introduce Git as a workflow/management solution to their researchers.

- You can work offline

- You can time-travel and go to different states of your work infinitely.


## *What's* Next?

- Use Git to update our DIEG teach-Ins. Together, we'll troubleshoot and learn in a way that allows us to use Git in a simplified, immediately usable way.
